A Personalized AI treatment recommendation system built under node js with python VENV on the backend and React on the frontend

## Running the program
#### Setting Up Your Development Environment

- Before you can start working with Python, NodeJS, and React, it is essential to set up your development environment properly.
- This includes installing the necessary tools, configuring your system, and setting up dependencies.
<p> Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

[Installing Python:](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your systemâ€™s PATH during installation, which allows you to run Python scripts from the command line.<br>
[Setting up NodeJS:](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system. Install NodeJS and ensure that both NodeJS and its package manager, npm, are added to your systemâ€™s PATH.<br>
Create-react-app:`vite + react:`The easiest way to set up a React project is by using the create-react-app tool, a CLI tool for generating boilerplate React applications. To install it, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
```
- Once installed, you can create a new React project using the command:

vite create-react-app project-name
- This command will generate a new React application with a pre-configured development environment and a basic folder structure.

<p>Additional Dependencies: Depending on your project requirements and chosen integration method, you may need to install additional dependencies, such as Flask, Django, or Express for server-side development. These can be installed using their respective package managers, such as pip for Python packages and npm for NodeJS packages.
</p>
Express: Write both frontend and backend code in JavaScript, Express is a popular web framework for NodeJS that can help you build server-side applications quickly and efficiently. Express can be combined with Python by creating API endpoints in Express that call Python scripts or functions using child processes or external libraries, such as python-shell.

### Backend 
To start the backend server proceed to the directory and add the following commands 

### Frontend
To run the frontend proceed with the following 

- Alternatively if you have docker installed and working you can proceed with the following steps 
### Docker
- go through the `docker-compose.yml` file



## Overview  
The objective of this project is to develop an AI recommendation system for personalized healthcare treatments based on patient data analysis. The system aims to address the challenges in providing tailored healthcare solutions to individuals, particularly in the context of East Africa. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and patient data, the system will generate customized treatment recommendations that take into account individual characteristics, medical history, and specific healthcare needs.



### Testing plan for the system
<p>The testing plan will be iterative, with regular test cycles and refinements based on the identified issues and feedback from various testing phases.</p>
- Individual components of the system, such as algorithms, data processing modules, and user interface elements, will undergo unit testing.
- Unit tests will be designed to verify the correctness of each component in isolation.
<p>Test cases will be created to cover various scenarios, including normal inputs, edge cases, and boundary conditions</p>
- Once the individual components have passed the unit testing phase, integration testing will be conducted. 
- Integration testing aims to detect any issues arising from the integration of various components and to ensure seamless system operation.
- Functional testing will assess the system's compliance with functional requirements and user expectations.
- Performance testing will assess the system's speed, responsiveness, and scalability under varying workloads.
- User acceptance testing involves involving end-users, such as healthcare professionals and patients, to evaluate the system's usability and effectiveness.
- Security testing will assess the system's vulnerability to potential security threats and ensure the protection of sensitive patient data.

## System Requirements
### Functional Requirements
<p>The functional requirements define the specific capabilities and functionalities that the AI recommendation system for personalized healthcare treatments should possess. These requirements are directly related to the system's primary functions and tasks.</p>
- The functional requirements for the system include Data Collection and Integration where the system should be able to gather patient data from various sources, such as electronic health records, diagnostic reports, and medical imaging systems.
- Personalized Treatment Recommendations.
- User Interface and Interaction. 
- System Integration.

### Non - Functional Requirements
<p>The non-functional requirements specify the characteristics and qualities that the AI recommendation system should possess.</p> 
- The system should incorporate robust security measures to protect patient data from unauthorized access, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
- Usability and User Experience.

- Scalability and Flexibility.
- Reliability and Availability.
